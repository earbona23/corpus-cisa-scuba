# MS.AAD.3.8v1: Managed devices SHOULD be required to register MFA.
Product: Microsoft Entra ID · Baseline: aad · Group: 3. Strong Authentication and a Secure Registration Process · Criticality: SHOULD

## Policy
Managed devices SHOULD be required to register MFA.

- _Rationale:_ Requiring a managed device provisioned and controlled by the agency to perform registration actions can reduce the risk of an adversary using stolen user credentials to register their own MFA device and access the tenant. This prevents the adversary from using their own unmanaged device for registration.

## License Requirements
- Policies related to managed devices require Microsoft Intune.

## Implementation
1. Create a conditional access policy requiring a user to be on a managed device when registering for MFA. Configure the following policy settings in the new conditional access policy, per the values below:

<pre>
  Users > Include > <b>All users</b>

  Target resources > User actions > <b>Register security information</b>

  Access controls > Grant > Grant Access > <b>Require device to be marked as compliant</b> and <b>Require Microsoft Entra ID hybrid joined device</b> > For multiple controls > <b>Require one of the selected controls</b>
</pre>
